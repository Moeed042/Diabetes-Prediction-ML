# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses a machine learning model to predict diabetes based on medical diagnostic data.

## 📘 Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze health parameters such as glucose level, BMI, age, and blood pressure to determine the likelihood of diabetes. The model is trained using the popular Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset and customized dataset parameters.

## 🧠 Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following features:

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Gender** | Biological gender (Male/Female) |
| **AGE** | Age of the patient |
| **Urea** | Urea level in the blood |
| **Cr** | Creatinine level (indicator of kidney function) |
| **HbA1c** | Glycated hemoglobin (indicator of blood sugar over time) |
| **Chol** | Total cholesterol level |
| **TG** | Triglycerides level |
| **HDL** | High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (“good” cholesterol) |
| **LDL** | Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (“bad” cholesterol) |
| **VLDL** | Very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol |
| **BMI** | Body Mass Index |
| **Class** | Target variable (e.g., Diabetic or Non-Diabetic) |

## 🧩 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature scaling and selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance visualization
